# BMI calculation

# Getting Started

BMI stands for Body Mass Index and it is a measure of the weight of each person, being a relation between the person's mass and their height squared.

From this calculation it is possible to assess whether the person is at an ideal weight or is under or over weight. Both levels below, and levels above the ideal weight, can pose risks to the individual's health.

This is an international reference measure recognized by the WHO (World Health Organization). It is a simple calculation to assess weight, but it does not directly measure body fat, as it does not include lean mass, fat mass, fluids and the bone structure of the person in question.

# Pay Atention!!
Heads up! Always look for a doctor!!
